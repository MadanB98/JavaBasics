Streams ---> Sequence of Data
1. ByteStream --> Byte streams handle data in raw binary format, making them suitable
                for handling all types of files, including text, images, audio, and video files.

2. CharacterStream --> handle data in character format, making them suitable for handling text files.

java.lang.Object
    ├── java.io.File
    ├── java.io.InputStream (Abstract)
    │   ├── java.io.FileInputStream --> Used to read bytes from a file.
    │   ├── java.io.BufferedInputStream -->is used to read information from stream.
                                         It internally uses buffer mechanism to make the performance fast.
    │   ├── java.io.ObjectInputStream --> Used to deserialize objects previously written using ObjectOutputStream
    │   └── java.io.DataInputStream --> Allows an application to read primitive Java data types from an underlying input stream.
    ├── java.io.OutputStream (Abstract)
    │   ├── java.io.FileOutputStream --> Used to write bytes to a file.
    │   ├── java.io.BufferedOutputStream --> is used for buffering an output stream. It internally uses buffer to store data
    │   ├── java.io.ObjectOutputStream --> Used to serialize objects to an output stream.
    │   └── java.io.DataOutputStream --> Is used to write primitive Java data types to an underlying output stream.
    ├── java.io.Reader (Abstract)
    │   ├── java.io.FileReader --> Used to read characters from a file.
    │   ├── java.io.BufferedReader --> is used to read the text from a character-based input stream.
                                        It can be used to read data line by line by readLine() method.
    │   ├── java.io.InputStreamReader --> is a bridge from byte streams to character streams:
                                It reads bytes and decodes them into characters using a specified charset.
    │   └── java.io.StringReader --> is a character stream with string as a source.
                                    It takes an input string and changes it into character stream.
    ├── java.io.Writer (Abstract)
    │   ├── java.io.FileWriter --> Used to write characters to a file.
    │   ├── java.io.BufferedWriter --> is used to write character-oriented data to a file.
    │   ├── java.io.OutputStreamWriter -->  is used to convert character stream to byte stream,
                                        the characters are encoded into byte using a specified charset.
    │   └── java.io.StringWriter ---> used to write common data to multiple files
    └── java.io.RandomAccessFile --> is used for reading and writing to random access file.
                                    A random access file behaves like a large array of bytes.
